This repostiory contains the templates and whatnot to generate my personal site
with Hyde.  There is a `fabfile.py` that can be used to deploy it.  Basically,
the results of generating the site are copied to the `nfoti.github.com` repo
that I have sitting next to this one locally and those files are added and
committed to that repo.  It's a bit confusing, but Hyde makes it much easier
to update the site and unfortunately github Pages can only use Jekyll to
generate sites.
